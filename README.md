Logical operators as perceptrons: AND Perceptron
How does the AND operator work?

It takes two inputs and returns an output.
**The inputs can be true or false, but the output is only true if both of the inputs are true.
**If the inputs are true and true, then the output is true.
**If the inputs are true and false, then the output is false.
**If the inputs are false and true, then the output is false.
**If the inputs are false and false, then the output is false.
